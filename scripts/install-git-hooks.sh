# Install sv0vm git hooks.
#
# Uses git's `core.hooksPath` so the tracked scripts/git-hooks/ directory is the
# single source of truth — edits take effect immediately, no copies to keep in
# sync. Re-run any time (idempotent). Hooks are bypassable with `--no-verify`
# or `SV0_SKIP_HOOKS=1`. Mirrors sv0-toolchain's own install-git-hooks.sh.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh   (from anywhere; resolves its own root)
